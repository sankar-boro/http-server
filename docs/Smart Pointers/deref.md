    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        let y = &x;

        assert_eq!(5, x);
        assert_eq!(5, *y);
    }

### Meaning of Deference

The variable x holds an i32 value, 5. We set y equal to a reference to x. We can assert that x is equal to 5. However, if we want to make an assertion about the value in y, we have to use *y to follow the reference to the value itâ€™s pointing to (hence dereference). Once we dereference y, we have access to the integer value y is pointing to that we can compare with 5.

### Custom Smart pointer

    use std::ops::Deref;

    struct MyBox<T>(T);

    impl<T> MyBox<T> {
        fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
            MyBox(x)
        }
    }


    impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
        type Target = T;

        fn deref(&self) -> &T {
            &self.0
        }
    }
